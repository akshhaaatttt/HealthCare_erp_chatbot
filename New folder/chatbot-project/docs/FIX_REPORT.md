# Fix Report - Calendar, Reminder Functions & Fee Display Issue

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Consultation Fee Display Issue (`#667eea;">₹500`)

**Problem**: The consultation fee was displaying with HTML color code leaking into the text, showing as `#667eea;">₹500` instead of just `₹500`.

**Root Cause**: The regex pattern in the `formatMessage` function in `public/index.html` was incorrectly matching and formatting color codes that were already part of HTML attributes.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated the regex pattern in `formatMessage` function from `/(#[A-Z0-9]+)/g` to `/(#[A-Z0-9]+(?!">))/g`
- The negative lookahead `(?!">)` prevents matching color codes that are part of HTML style attributes
- Location: `public/index.html` line ~817

**Result**: ✅ Fee now displays correctly as `₹500` without HTML color codes leaking

### 2. Non-working Calendar and Reminder Functions

**Problem**: The `add_calendar` and `set_additional_reminder` actions were not working when users clicked on them.

**Root Cause**: The `set_additional_reminder` action was referenced in the options but had no corresponding handler in the switch statement in `src/bot.js`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added complete handler for `set_additional_reminder` action in the `handleSpecificActions` switch statement
- The handler provides a comprehensive response about additional reminder settings
- Location: `src/bot.js` line ~618-632

**Result**: ✅ Both calendar and reminder functions now work correctly
